# Basics

## Programming concepts
    - Values
    - Operations
    - Variables
    - Expressions and Statements
    - Decisions
    - Loops
    - Functions

### Values

Values in Javascript are something of the form shown below. Nitpick: In some other programming langauges first and second might be different because second has decimals but in Javascript both are same.

    - 42 : number
    - 3.14 : number
    - "Hello world" : string
    - true : boolean
    - false : boolean
    - null
    - undefined
    - [1,2,3,5,7]
    - {name : "Sourav"}


## Three pillars of javascript
    - Types and coercion
    - Scope and closures
    - This and prototypes
