## Why webpack

#### How do we use Javascript in the browser? Currently there are only two ways of doing that.
    + First is to add a `script` tag and load the JS file
    + Write the JS directly in HTML file : *This obviously doesn't scale*

#### *What are the problem with the above two approaches*
#### **Doesn't SCALE ðŸ“ˆ**
    1. Either we have too many scripts which we try to load from HTML
    2. Browser bottlenecks : There are only certain number of concurrent requests that can fetch data at a single
       time. So breaking the code into 1000 files is certainly a
       performance bottle neck. But what about HTTP2? Not really since the number of modules is of the range ~1000
    3. Unmaintable scripts with 1000 lines of code : There is problem with scope, size, readability and fragility
    4. With advent of IIFE patterns, devs started exploiting it to concatenate scripts since there was no scope leakage.
       This along with tools like gulp, grunt would stitch the script. But this also meant everytime you changed some
       thing you need to rerun the build to stitch script. Also concatenating also meant introducing lot of dead code.
       And also slow running apps.
    5. With node js landing in to the game, there was another problem. How do you load script if there is no HTML.

##### And thus the birth of module patterns like CommonJS using  `require` syntax that allowed injecting other pieces of module into current module.

```jsx
//File 1

//default export
module.exports = (first, second) => first/second;

//File 2
const divideFn = require("./division");

//Named exports
exports.add = (first, second) => first + second;
exports.substract = (first, second) => first - second;
exports.divide = divideFn;

//File 3
const path = require("path");
const {add, substract} = require("./math");
const sum = add(5,5);
const diff = substract(10,2);
```
##### And this is how the explosion of Javascript started. We then had NPM which was created as a registry to share Common JS node modules across an entire ecosystem.
